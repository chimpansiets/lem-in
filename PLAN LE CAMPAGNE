El plan:

Step 1: Set up graph using adjacency lists (https://medium.com/basecs/from-theory-to-practice-representing-graphs-cfd782c5be38).
Step 2: Loop through the graph and level the rooms using Breadth First Search (BFS).
(https://medium.com/basecs/going-broad-in-a-graph-bfs-traversal-959bd1a09255).

!!!!
some how it screws up the names of the room, if you check input
it will show "abcm6" after that it shows Room6
so i think it overwrites a roomname somewhere because its combination of abc and Room6.
maybe got something to do with memalloc??
!!!!

error_handling is new, the idea you came up with (variadic arguments) is implemented.
i made some comments in the function because somehow it didnt show leaks without even
sending the line and free it in our error_handling function. not checked with valgrind.
please test it to check if you find any errors, the error_nr 7 is a bit tricky i guess.
